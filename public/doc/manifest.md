# BADGE MANIFESTO  
**A declaration of independence from bloated software.**
---


## CODE IS NOT PROGRESS. FUNCTION IS.

BADGE is not a framework. It’s a **refusal**.

A refusal of:
- Indirection
- Dependency-by-default
- Abstraction for abstraction’s sake

Modern web development is collapsing under the weight of its own tools. This is a counter-offensive.


### 1. Bloat is the industry norm.

- Your `composer.lock` is bigger than the Apollo 11 codebase.
- Your React app loads 20MB to say “Hello World.”
- Your Laravel stack autoloads 2 million lines to serve static pages.

**This is not engineering. It’s theater.**


### 2. Frameworks teach allegiance, not understanding.

Most devs know their toolchain, not their language.  
They can configure `vite.config.js`, but can’t explain `$_SERVER`.

The craft has been replaced by cargo cults.


### 3. Abstractions are built for vendors, not users.

Meta wants you in React.  
Vercel wants you in Next.  
Laravel wants you at Laracon.

Your tools are optimized for their ecosystems—not your outcomes.


### 4. Most apps need ~5 primitives.

You don’t need:
- DI containers
- SPAs
- GraphQL
- ORM
- 1GB Docker images

You need:
- Input
- Output
- State
- A database
- A brain


### 5. DX is killing clarity.

Every convenience you add hides one more moving part.

“Developer Experience” is just User Experience for devs who don’t want to learn.


## BADGE IS THE ALTERNATIVE

BADGE is a procedural micro-stack for serious developers.

- ~300 lines of PHP
- No magic
- No routing tables
- No dependency injection
- Just files and functions

You know what runs. You control what executes.

---

## CALL TO ACTION

- Start with a file.
- Build what you understand.
- Ship something small and sane.

BADGE doesn’t scale by indirection.  
It scales by composition.
